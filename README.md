# Character-Driven Relationship Framework

This repository contains a comprehensive framework for creating engaging LLM-based Discord personas using Anthropic's Claude. Designed to be both flexible and robust, the system enables you to explore a wide range of relationship dynamics—from mentorships and familial bonds to professional collaborations and beyond.

---

## Overview

The framework is built around four key components:

1. **Character Definition Template**  
   Create richly detailed personas with distinctive traits, communication styles, and a dual-mode system. The bot dynamically adjusts its presentation based on context.

2. **Interaction Principles**  
   Establish and evolve relationship dynamics by following clear guidelines—from the initial encounter to deep, multifaceted connections. The system breaks down relationship progression into distinct stages, ensuring natural development and engagement.

3. **Memory Archiving System**  
   Record relationship developments using two formats:
   - A **comprehensive record** that tracks long-term evolution.
   - A **quick update format** for real-time insights and recent interactions.

   This dual approach captures both overarching themes and immediate details, with conversation summarization triggered when the conversation exceeds a configurable token threshold (default: **25,000 tokens**).

4. **Customization Guide**  
   Adapt the framework to various relationship types (romantic, familial, mentorship, adversarial, platonic, professional).

> **Note:** For detailed instructions on creating characters using our template, please refer to our [Character Creation Guideline](./CharacterCreationGuideline.md).
> For orchestration of multi-character interactions, see the [Hypervisor System Prompt](./HypervisorSystemPrompt.md) and the [hypervisor module](./hypervisor.py).

## Features & Improvements

### **Enhanced Bot Reply Logic**

#### **Direct Messages (DMs)**
- **Always Replies:** The bot always responds to DMs.  
- **Personal & Intimate:** The conversation context remains private, allowing for a more casual, personal, and intimate interaction style.

#### **Public Channels**
- **Sophisticated Reply Decision System:**  
  - The bot will reply if explicitly mentioned by name.
  - For messages not explicitly addressed to it, the bot uses an LLM-based voting system to decide whether to reply.
  - Multiple yes/no votes are collected from the LLM to ensure more consistent decisions.
  - Enhanced voting logging provides visibility into why bots decide to reply or not.
  
- **Natural Multi-Bot Conversations:**
  - Sophisticated LLM-based entity detection identifies when multiple bots/characters are mentioned.
  - Intelligent wait system creates more natural conversation sequences when multiple bots are mentioned.
  - Bots will wait their turn if another entity is mentioned first, creating more human-like conversation flows.
  - Dynamically calculates appropriate wait times based on whether the message sender is a human or bot.

- **Enhanced Channel Context Awareness:**
  - Improved context management with clear channel/server identification.
  - Better separation between conversations in different channels.
  - Maintains relationship continuity across channels while focusing on current channel's topic.
  - Records recent channel messages to provide situational awareness in multi-user conversations.

- **Bot Reply Throttling:**  
  - System prevents bot-to-bot conversation loops by limiting consecutive replies to other bots.
  - Adds cooldown period between replies to the same bot to prevent race conditions.
  - Configurable reply threshold limits how many times a bot will respond to another bot.

### **Realistic Typing Simulation**
- **Dynamic Typing Speed:**
  - Calculates typing time based on response length (not input length).
  - Shows typing indicator for a realistic duration based on character count.
  - Adds natural variance to typing speed to appear more human-like.
  - Configurable typing speed, minimum and maximum typing times.
  - Extended typing indicator that refreshes to prevent it from timing out.

### **Enhanced Configuration System**
- **Split Configuration Files**: 
  - `config.env` - Technical settings, timeouts, models, etc.
  - `character.env` - Character-specific prompts and personality
- **Direct Character Configuration**:
  - Character prompts are defined directly in the env files
  - Simpler management of multiple character personas
- **Organized Folder Structure**:
  - Each character can have its own folder with dedicated configuration
  - Example personas included (see characters in the `/characters/` folder)

### **Robust Error Handling & Stability**
- **Heartbeat System**: 
  - Monitors connection health to prevent shard timeouts
  - Tracks latency across shards and logs warnings for high latency
  - Periodically reports status to ensure system health
- **Asyncio Task Architecture**: 
  - Non-blocking message processing to maintain responsiveness
  - Creates separate tasks for potentially slow operations
  - Prevents a single slow operation from blocking the entire bot
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: 
  - Graceful recovery from API errors and timeouts
  - Fallback responses when Claude API calls fail
  - Detailed error logging with optional verbose mode
- **Timeout Protection:**
  - Configurable timeouts for LLM calls, conversation summarization, and reply decisions
  - Graceful fallback responses when timeouts occur
  - Prevents bot from appearing unresponsive during slow operations

### **Memory System Enhancements**
- **Improved Core Memory Management:**
  - Automatic token count estimation to prevent exceeding limits
  - Special handling for oversized core memories with additional prompting
  - Archival system for preserving historical memory states
- **Enhanced Conversation Summarization:**
  - Triggered when conversation exceeds configurable token threshold
  - Preserves relationship continuity while managing token usage
  - Intelligently updates core memories based on significant interactions
- **Memory Pickle Dumps:**
  - Optional logging of memory state changes for debugging
  - Timestamped pickle files for tracking memory evolution
  - Configurable directory for memory archives

### **Interactive UI Elements**
- **Message Reroll System:**
  - Interactive buttons for accepting, dismissing, or redoing responses
  - Ephemeral messages for previewing potential responses
  - Smooth transition from preview to public messages
- **Selective Message Forgetting:**
  - UI for selecting specific messages to remove from conversation history
  - Visual indicators for selected messages
  - Confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletions
- **Conversation Reset:**
  - Confirmation dialog for resetting conversation
  - Preserves core memories while clearing conversation history

### **Running the Bot:**  
Start the bot by running:
```bash
python main.py
```

---

## Premium & Standard Model System

The framework supports two tiers of Claude models:
- **Standard Model** (`DEFAULT_MODEL`): Used for regular users (default: claude-3-5-sonnet-latest)
- **Premium Model** (`PREMIUM_MODEL`): Used for users with premium status (default: claude-3-7-sonnet-latest)

Admins can toggle a user's premium status using the `premium [user_id]` command in the log channel.

---

## Sharding Support

For larger deployments, the bot supports Discord sharding:
- Configure `shard_count` in your `config.env` file
- The bot will automatically use `AutoShardedBot` when `shard_count` > 1
- The heartbeat monitoring system tracks shard health and reports latency issues

---

- `min_typing_time`: Minimum seconds to show typing indicator (default: 6.0)
- `max_typing_time`: Maximum seconds to show typing indicator (default: 15.0)
- `typing_variance`: Random variation in typing speed (default: 0.2 or ±20%)
